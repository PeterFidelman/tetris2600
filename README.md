# Tetris for Atari 2600
Written January-February 2018 for a 4k coding demoparty at Blue Origin.

I am most proud of its music, because most Tetris homebrews don't bother with that.  It is not as cool as [Chetiry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vo6sVgIZs7Y)... but then again, Chetiry needs 32K and the [DPC coprocessor](https://www.atariage.com/store/index.php?l=page_view&p=atariage_melody), so it's not really an apples-to-apples comparison.

## Development
This uses the [wla-dx](https://github.com/vhelin/wla-dx) assembler, so you will need to install that if you haven't already.  To assemble, run `make.sh`.  This will give you a ROM that you can run in Stella or whatever.

I haven't tested it on a real 2600, so hopefully it doesn't explode your TV.
